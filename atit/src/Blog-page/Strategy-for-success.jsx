                                            <p class="secondary-text">1. Active Reading: Engage actively with the study material by highlighting key points, taking notes, and summarising key concepts. This approach enhances understanding and promotes better retention.</p>
                                            <p class="secondary-text">2. Mind Mapping: Visualise complex information by creating mind maps, which help establish connections and facilitate recall during the exam.</p>
                                            <p class="secondary-text">3. Practice Questions: Solve practice questions and previous years' papers to familiarise yourself with the exam format and identify your areas of strength and weakness. This process simulates the actual exam environment, making you more confident on the big day.</p>
                                            <p class="secondary-text">4. Group Study: Collaborating with peers who are also preparing for the same exam can be beneficial, as it allows for knowledge sharing, group discussions, and mutual support. However, ensure that group study sessions remain focused and productive.</p>
