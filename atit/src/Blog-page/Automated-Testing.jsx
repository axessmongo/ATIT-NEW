                                                    One of the sectors in our day that is expanding the fastest is ‘Software Development’. The necessity for automated services like automation testing to supplement laborious manual testing is growing along with the need for technology.
                                                    Automation testing is the process of testing software using tools and technologies in order to minimise testing effort and deliver capability more quickly and cheaply. It facilitates the creation of higher-quality software with less work
                                                </p>

                                                    Although a lot of businesses already employ some form of automated testing, many still mostly rely on manual testing since they are ill-equipped to fully utilise the advantages of this type of testing in their development process.
                                                    Introducing automated tests into an organisation requires a substantial time and effort investment. Businesses whose primary product(s) is(are) not software-related are typically reluctant to invest in automation testing for concern that the results won't meet expectations or that there won't be any ROI at all.
                                                    Let's examine the benefits of automation testing and why your company needs it in the remaining sections of this blog.

                                                    First and foremost, quicker Time to Market (TTM) is the primary justification for choosing software test automation.
                                                    How then does it operate? Automated tests automatically compare the findings obtained with the expected results using a pre-designed scenario as their foundation.
                                                    Tests that necessitate repeatedly performing the same tasks are expedited by it. Automation thus takes the place of labour-intensive, repetitive, and time-consuming manual testing. As a result, QAs can better allocate their time by concentrating on more in-depth and inventive tests to find hidden flaws

                                                    The ability for Quality Assurance specialists to complete more testing in less time is another benefit of automation testing over manual testing.
                                                    When doing manual testing, quality assurance professionals typically go through application screens with great attention, experimenting with different use cases and input combinations, comparing the outcomes to what is expected, and documenting their findings. They must actively participate in every step of the process, from creating test cases to carrying out the tests themselves.
                                                    Changes to the source code and other scenarios, including different hardware setups and operating systems, necessitate frequent testing.
                                                    On the other hand, tests in automated testing are carried out automatically using test automation frameworks in conjunction with additional hardware and software.
                                                    Not only may automated tests be run far more quickly than manual tests, but they can also be expanded to carry out activities that manual testing is not able to. They are less error-prone and less labour-intensive.

                                                    Increased test coverage, which enables teams to scale up their suites and run tests concurrently on several devices and operating systems, is another significant advantage of automated testing.
                                                    One indicator of test quality is Test Coverage. It shows the extent to which the application being tested has been put through its paces.
                                                    Although it limits the number of tests that can be run, manual testing can help you obtain high-quality test cases.

                                                    By recording software flaws, automation testing greatly facilitates "shift-left" testing, or moving testing closer to the beginning of programme development. Developers can fix software faster with instant feedback and real-time status reporting that includes logging of all occurrences and failures.
                                                    Putting the planning and development of test automation on the left also makes it necessary for you to thoroughly document your features and user pathways. In conclusion, well-planned test automation that has been written sooner results in early fault discovery, which leads to quicker delivery and better products.
                                                    Furthermore, automation frequently enables us to find flaws that human testing were unable to find. Because human error can occur during the manual testing process, it may not be as accurate as the automated method, which is based on code and scripts.
                                                    Some important considerations when deciding if automated software testing should be chosen are as follows

                                                    Robust software is built on both automated and manual testing. As soon as you begin implementing your programme, you need to consider testing. You may need to develop a systematic testing approach and an automation strategy, particularly if your product will have sophisticated functionality. By doing this, you can keep your software error-free and in top shape.
                                                    Keep in mind that manual testing is still possible after automation testing. Additionally, the two kinds work well together. Similar to manual testing, automated testing necessitates a plan that is preceded by appropriate methods for planning, monitoring, and control.
                                                    One of the best places to receive IT training is ATIT.
