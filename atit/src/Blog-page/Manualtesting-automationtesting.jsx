                        DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MANUAL TESTING AND AUTOMATION TESTING
                      </h1>
                      <p className="secondary-text">
                        In the field of testing, automation testing has become
                        popular. While guaranteeing a bug-free user experience,
                        it has assisted businesses in bringing new products to
                        market more quickly. In order to keep up with the
                        expansion of various devices, browsers, and operating
                        systems, it has guaranteed a tremendous rise in test
                        coverage while also improving the productivity of
                        developers and QA testers. Manual testing has maintained
                        its unique position, nonetheless. There are many
                        different types of testing, including load testing,
                        system testing, system integration testing, black-box
                        testing, and white-box testing. While some of these
                        testing categories yield better results when tested
                        manually, some perform better when tested automatically.

                        step-by-step without the use of tools, while the latter
                        uses automation tools and frameworks to carry out the

                        Why Use Automation Testing Over Manual Testing?
                      </h2>
                      <p className="secondary-text">
                        The process of manually testing software or apps without
                        the aid of automated tools or scripts is known as manual
                        testing. It takes a lot of time and effort because
                        testers design test cases and run tests in this
                        situation. Manual testing is not the best method if we
                        want to test a major feature of our app on 50–60
                        different devices, operating systems, and web browsers.
                        Rather of wasting time and effort, you may access
                        hundreds of browser-device-OS combinations by employing
                        automation tools.

                      <h2 className="secondary-header">
                        Some compelling arguments in favour of automation
                        testing over manual testing are as follows:
                      </h2>
                      <p className="secondary-text">
                        Time-saving: It goes without saying that manual testing
                        slows down the entire software development lifecycle
                        because it is laborious and repetitive. By automating
                        all repetitive operations, automation testing improves
                        the software development life cycle and saves a
                        significant amount of time. - Less Manual Tasks: You can
                        write test cases once and utilise them again in
                        automation testing. A thorough bug report for the
                        unsuccessful case can be generated using certain
                        high-quality automation technologies, thus enhancing the
                        accuracy and potency of automation. - Cost-effective:
                        Software of the highest calibre will need to be manually
                        tested by a specialised testing team. However, in
                        automation testing, a small team or even a single person
                        can automate the entire testing process. - Team
                        collaboration: Teamwork is crucial when doing complex
                        testing; manual testing makes this very difficult, but
                        with automated testing, adding team members to review or
                        contribute to the test cases is simple. - Easy to
                        manage: Compared to manual testing, automation testing
                        is easier to manage. With automation testing, a single
                        graphical user interface can manage and automate the
                        entire testing process.

                        Finding the ideal mix between manual and automated
                        testing is crucial for a highly productive engineering
                        team that creates amazing websites and apps. This keeps
                        expenses under control and guarantees the quick launch
                        of bug-free websites and apps. Determining which tests
                        will be performed manually and which will be automated
                        is a crucial step in the process. Following that, it is
                        important to plan for capacity for both manual testing
                        (i.e., the number of users) and automation testing
                        (i.e., the number of users and parallels). As a result,
                        the ideal solution that maximises costs, speed, and
                        coverage may be developed.
