                                            <p class="secondary-text">Candidate: Sure! My favorite project was developing a web application for an e-commerce platform. It was challenging because I had to work with a team and coordinate different aspects of the project, such as frontend design, backend functionality, and database management. But it taught me a lot about collaboration and communication within a team.</p>

                                            <p class="secondary-text">Interviewer: Collaboration is crucial in the IT industry. Speaking of teamwork, can you tell me about a time when you faced a conflict within a team project and how you resolved it?</p>
                                            <p class="secondary-text">Candidate: Certainly! During the e-commerce project, we had a disagreement about the technology stack to use. Some team members favored a particular framework, while others had different preferences. To resolve the conflict, we organized a meeting where everyone presented their arguments. We then collectively evaluated the pros and cons and finally reached a consensus that ensured all team members felt heard and valued.</p>

                                            <p class="secondary-text">Candidate: Of course! During my database management project, we faced an issue with data synchronization between servers. It was affecting the performance and reliability of the application. To resolve it, I researched various database replication techniques and implemented the one that best suited our project's requirements. It took some trial and error, but eventually, we achieved seamless data synchronization.</p>
